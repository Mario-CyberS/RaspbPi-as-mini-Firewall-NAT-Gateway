# Raspberry Pi as Mini Firewall + NAT Gateway for Tailscale RDP Access  
This project demonstrates how to use a **Raspberry Pi** as a **firewall and NAT gateway**, allowing a **MacBook to remotely wake and access a Windows PC** via **Tailscale**, while routing all PC internet traffic through the Pi. The setup is designed to work even on captive portal Wi-Fi networks via a travel router.

---

## üéØ Objective  
To configure a **remote-accessible NAT gateway firewall** using a Raspberry Pi that routes a Windows PC‚Äôs traffic through it, and supports RDP access via Tailscale ‚Äî even in restricted network environments like apartments or hotels.

---

## üîß Hardware Needed  

| Component | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Raspberry Pi 3B+ or 4 | With Pi OS Lite |
| 16GB+ microSD card | Used for OS image |
| USB-to-Ethernet Adapter | For second NIC |
| Ethernet Cables (x2) | Router ‚Üí Pi, Pi ‚Üí PC |
| Windows PC | Target for RDP |
| MacBook | Remote control device |
| GL.iNet Travel Router | Provides internet bypassing captive portal |

---

## Step 1: Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite  

1. Download Raspberry Pi Imager from [RaspberryPi.com](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Select OS: `Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)`
3. Set custom options:
   - Hostname: `Raspberrypi`
   - User: `User` (match Windows PC)
   - Enable SSH and set Wi-Fi (if needed)
4. Flash SD card
5. Eject and insert into Pi. Power it on with monitor + keyboard or SSH from mac.

---

## Step 2: Set Up Tailscale on Raspberry Pi  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use unrestricted Wi-Fi or a **travel router** if on captive portal.

Configure Travel Router (GL.iNet):
1. Connect to router‚Äôs Wi-Fi: `GL-XXXX`
2. Visit: [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1)
3. Go to: `Internet > Repeater`  
4. Connect to apartment SSID and log in through captive portal

On Pi (via SSH or terminal):
```bash
sudo raspi-config  # Connect to travel routers SSID (System Options > Wireless LAN)
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscaled &
sudo tailscale up
tailscale ip -4  # Confirm 100.x.x.x IP
sudo apt install net-tools iptables iproute2 curl nano -y
```
If you have unrestrictive wifi then no need for a travel router.

### Add ACLs in Tailscale Admin Panel:
```bash
{
  "acls": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["Mario-CyberS@github"],
      "dst": ["tag:home:3389"]
    },
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["Mario-CyberS@github"],
      "dst": ["tag:relay-node:*"]
    }
  ],
  "tagOwners": {
    "tag:home": ["Mario-CyberS@github"],
    "tag:relay-node": ["Mario-CyberS@github"]
  }
}
```
Then go to the machines section and add the relay-node tag to your pi device. 
- Click the 3 dots ‚ãÆ next to your Pi
- Click Edit tags
- Set to: tag: relay-node

Note: the home tag access is to allow my mac access to my Windows PC.

## Step 3: Install & Configure DHCP + NAT  
Run on: Raspberry Pi

Install dhcpcd:
```bash
which dhcpcd  # If missing:
sudo apt install dhcpcd5 -y
sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd
sudo systemctl start dhcpcd
```
Configure Static IP on `eth1`:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```
Append:
```bash
interface eth1
static ip_address=192.***.**.1/24
nohook wpa_supplicant
```
Restart Networking:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd
sudo systemctl status dhcpcd 
ip a  # Verify eth1 shows 192.***.**.1/24
```

---

## Step 4: Enable NAT Routing and IP Forwarding  
Run on: Raspberry Pi
```bash
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

sudo apt install iptables-persistent -y
sudo netfilter-persistent save
```

---

## Step 5: Install DHCP Server for PC  

```bash
sudo apt install dnsmasq -y
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
```
Append:
```conf
interface=eth1
dhcp-range=192.***.**.10,192.***.**.100,12h
```
Restart:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```
Now your Windows PC (connected to Pi via Ethernet)

---

## Step 6: Configure Windows PC  

Connect Ethernet to Pi
Set PC IP via DHCP or manually:
  - IP: `192.168.50.10`
  - Gateway: `192.168.50.1`
Test internet access and RDP
Enable:
  - Remote Desktop (Settings > System > Remote Desktop)
  - Wake-on-LAN in BIOS/UEFI
  - Make Firewall Rule persistent
  - And we'll make some other critical changes below

### Make the Rule Persistent and Force it ON at Boot
You can create a Startup Task that automatically runs Enable-NetFirewallRule each time your PC boots up.
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Click Create Task (not "Basic Task")
3. Under General tab:
Name: Enable RDP Firewall
Run whether user is logged on or not
Run with highest privileges
4. Under Triggers:
New ‚Üí At Startup
5. Under Actions:
Start a program ‚Üí
Program/script: 
```bash
powershell.exe 
```
```bash
-Command "Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup 'Remote Desktop'"
```
Save and Exit

Security Impact:
This is safe because you‚Äôre only re-enabling the Windows built-in RDP rules ‚Äî you're not creating new loose ports.
However, always ensure you're connecting through Tailscale IP only, not allowing public internet access.

### Set Up Wake-on-LAN over Tailscale
Enable Wake-on-LAN in BIOS:
- Reboot your Windows PC
- Enter BIOS Setup
Restart PC and hold F2 (need wired keyboard)
- Find Power Management section
- Enable:
Wake on LAN
Wake on PCI-E/PCI device
Save and exit.

### Configure Windows to Allow Wake
In Windows:
- Go to Device Manager > Network Adapters
- Find your Ethernet or WiFi adapter
- Right-click ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Power Management tab
- Enable:
Allow this device to wake the computer
Only allow a magic packet to wake the computer

### Disable Windows "Fast Startup" (Critical)
Fast Startup breaks Wake-on-LAN on a lot of machines by default.
Steps:
- Go to Control Panel ‚Üí Hardware and Sound ‚Üí Power Options ‚Üí Choose what the power buttons do 
- Click "Change settings that are currently unavailable"
- Under Shutdown settings, UNCHECK: Turn on fast startup (recommended)

- Next do these in the Advanced Tab:

Wake on Magic Packet: Enabled

Wake on Pattern Match: Enabled

Shutdown Wake-On-LAN: Enabled

Low Power Idle: Disabled (if present)

---

## Step 7: Test Wake + RDP from Mac  
Put the PC to sleep then ssh into your Pi from your mac terminal
Then from Terminal:
```bash
ping <PC-Tailscale-IP>
```
PC should wake from sleep.
Launch Microsoft Remote Desktop on your mac and you should be able to connect to your PC!

---

## Optional: Lock Down PC Traffic  

Example, allow only RDP, block everything else from PC:
```bash
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -p tcp --dport 3389 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -j DROP
sudo netfilter-persistent save
```
Or block known telemetry IPs/ranges from PC.
